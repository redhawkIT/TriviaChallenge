# Trivia Challenge 

## Technical Breakdown

- Modern responsive single page React web app built with hooks and the lastest javascript features
- [react-router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/) provides the SPA with routes, links, and history
- Route based code-splitting using React Suspense and Lazy loading
- [reduxjs/toolkit](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit) provides all the bells and whistles of the redux ecosystems without the hassle
- State that needs to be preserved across routes is stored in redux
- [material-ui](https://material-ui.com/) for faster and easier web components - Well tested and supports IE-11 and accessibility support
- Save [opentdb](https://opentdb.com/) tokens to local storage to manage user sessions, allowing a user to come back and refresh the page and not get the same questions
- Free hosting and one step deployments via [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) 


## Features

- Responsive from desktop to mobile
- Handles user session, so questions are not repeated
- Change the number of questions, categories, difficulty, and type
- Review the quiz results 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
